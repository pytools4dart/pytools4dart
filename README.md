![licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3-blue.svg)
![build status](https://gitlab.com/pytools4dart/pytools4dart/badges/master/pipeline.svg)

The API is maintained under python 3, although it may also work under python 2 although it is not maintained anymore.

## Installation

All installation details are available in the 
[installation guide](https://pytools4dart.gitlab.io/pytools4dart/docs/user_guides/00_installation/).

## Features

The python API covers most of DART features and more:

- DART simulation reader/writer
- full parametrisation of any type of simulation
- several proxies and summaries to most used parameters:
    - scene 
        - scene and cell size, 
        - plots, objects, trees, 
        - optical and thermic properties,
    - sensor
        - bands wavelength and bandwidth
    - source:
        - sun angles
- sequence generator
- DART runners:
    - direction
    - phase
    - maket
    - dart
    - full
    - sequence
    - colorCompositeBands
- pre/post-processing tools:
    - hyperspectral tools (hstools): read ENVI .hdr files, extract wavelengths and bandwidths, stack results to ENVI file
    - voxreader :
        - read voxelised scene in AMAPvox file
        - intersect voxels with polygons to define properties
    - DART2LAS: 
        - extract returns with gaussian decomposition (accelerated with C++ backend)
        - convert lidar simulation results to LAS files (full-waveform and returns only)
        
Many variables are pandas DataFrame objects, and can be directly 
interacted with by the user.
