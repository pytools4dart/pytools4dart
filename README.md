[![build status](https://gitlab.com/pytools4dart/pytools4dart/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/pytools4dart/pytools4dart/pipelines/latest)

The API is maintained under python 3. It may also work under python 2 although it is not maintained/tested anymore.

## Installation

All installation details are available in the 
[installation guide](https://pytools4dart.gitlab.io/pytools4dart/docs/user_guides/00_installation/).

## Features

The python API covers most of DART features and more:

- __Configurable__ with any DART version
- __Load and/or Create__ DART simulation files
- __Full Parametrisation__ of any type of simulation
- __Proxies & Summaries__ to most used parameters: scene elements (sizes, objects, properties), sensor bands, source
- __DART Runners__: run simulations step by step (direction, phase, ...) or fully, run/resume sequence processing
- __Sequence Generator__
- __Pre/Post-Processing tools__:
    - hyperspectral tools (hstools): read ENVI .hdr files, extract wavelengths and bandwidths, stack band images to ENVI file
    - voxreader : load voxelisation file/data, intersect with polygons/raster to define properties, export to simulation plots
    - DART2LAS: lidar processing tools
        - extract returns with gaussian decomposition of lidar waveforms (accelerated with C++ backend) 
        - convert lidar simulation results to LAS files (full-waveform and returns only)

    proxies:
    - scene 
        - scene and cell size, 
        - plots, objects, trees, 
        - optical and thermic properties,
    - sensor
        - bands wavelength and bandwidth
    - source:
        - sun angles
    runners:
    - direction
    - phase
    - maket
    - dart
    - full
    - sequence
    - colorCompositeBands

Many variables are pandas DataFrame objects, and can be directly 
interacted with by the user.
