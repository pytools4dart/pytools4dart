The python package `pytools4dart` was developed to address scripted simulations, especially for simulations with dimensions,
number of parameters or complexity not manageable with DART graphical interface. Typical examples are the production of 
a 3D mockups with thousands of voxels or objects and thousands of optical properties 
(e.g. voxelised lidar data intersected with crown specific bio-chemical traits), 
or the specification of hundreds of spectral bands to simulate a hyperspectral sensor. Another example is to load 
The package `pytools4dart` extends DART to complex and massive simulation with the power of python for pre/post processing and analysis, by making possible
the connection to any other python packages (rasterio, laspy, scikitlearn, ...). It also extends DART to computing 
on headless server, typically HPC servers. And with python scripting, it allows for easy lightweight version control, e.g. with git,
to keep track of your simulation history.

## Features

The python API covers most of DART features and more:

- __Configurable__ with any version of DART
- __Load and/or Create__ DART simulation files
- __Full Parametrisation__ of any type of simulation
- __Proxies & Summaries__ to most used parameters: scene elements (sizes, objects, properties), sensor bands, source
- __DART Runners__: run simulations step by step (direction, phase, ...) or fully, run/resume sequence processing, on remote server
- __Sequence Generator__
- __Pre/Post-Processing tools__:
    - hyperspectral tools (hstools): read ENVI .hdr files, extract wavelengths and bandwidths, stack band images to ENVI file
    - voxreader : load voxelisation file/data, intersect with polygons/raster to define properties, export to simulation plots
    - DART2LAS: lidar processing tools
        - extract returns with gaussian decomposition of lidar waveforms (accelerated with C++ backend) 
        - convert lidar simulation results to LAS files (full-waveform and returns only)
    - Prospect: generate thousands of optical properties from bio-chemical traits
- __Tutorials__ : several use cases documented to facilitate the development of your own simulations.

    proxies:
    - scene 
        - scene and cell size, 
        - plots, objects, trees, 
        - optical and thermic properties,
    - sensor
        - bands wavelength and bandwidth

Many variables are pandas DataFrame objects, and can be directly 
interacted with by the user.

## Install

Recommended installation is under conda:

```bash
conda env create --name myptd pytools4dart/ptdvenv -v
conda activate myptd
python -c 'import pytools4dart as ptd; ptd.configure(r"<path to DART directory>")' # e.g. r"~/DART", r"C:\DART"
```
