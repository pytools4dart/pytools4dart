# pytools4dart: python API for [DART](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/dart/index.php#/) simulator


## Installation

All installation details are available in the [installation guide](https://gitlab.com/pytools4dart/pytools4dart).

## Features
At the moment only part of DART simulator features are supported:
- create 'flux' simulation
- scene and cell size definition
- bands, plots, optical properties management
- simulation sequence generator
- DART xml writers
- DART runners:
    - direction
    - phase
    - maket
    - dart
    - full
    - sequence
    - colorCompositeBands
- hyperspectral tools: read ENVI .hdr files, extract wavelengths and bandwidths, stack results to ENVI file
- lidar tools: read voxelized scene

Check [website](https://pytools4dart.gitlab.io/pytools4dart) for details and user guides.
Use cases examples are also available in directory `examples`.


###### Create simulation

`simulation` creates an object with methods and variables to ease 
the synthesis and understanding of the general properties of a given 
simulation.

Many variables are pandas DataFrame objects, and can be directly 
interacted with by the user.

To create a new simulation:
```python
import pytools4dart as ptd
simu = ptd.simulation('new_simulation')
print(simu)
```

Parameters of `simu` are in:
```python
simu.bands # spectral products
simu.optprops # optical properties of mokup elements
simu.scene # scene size
simu.cell # cell size
simu.plots # turbid plots
self.trees # lollipop trees
```

See help pages and `examples` for more details.
